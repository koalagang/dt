# dt
dt is a [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) shell rewrite.

If you haven't heard of doctoc before, here's its description: "Generates table of contents for markdown files inside local git repository. Links are compatible with anchors generated by github or other sites via a command line flag."

I wrote this script because I think that 128 lines of JavaScript is unncessary when you can do the same job in less than 60 lines of POSIX shell.\
You can test dt with a great application called [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) which allows you to preview GitHub README.md files.

## Installation

### cURL

```sh
sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koalagang/dt/main/dt" -o /usr/bin/dt
```

### Manual

Download the script, mark it as executable and then place it anywhere in your `$PATH`.
You can easily do this by navigating to the directory you wish to install it to and then running:
```sh
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koalagang/crunchyroll-cli/main/crunchyroll-cli" && chmod +x crunchyroll-cli
```

## Usage

For dt to function, you must add the following to your markdown file (place it where you want the table of contents to be):
```sh
<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN dt TO UPDATE -->
<!-- END dt generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
```

You can specify the file you want dt to work with like so:
```sh
dt hello-world.md
```
However dt does not actually require any arguments if you are already in the directory containing the file and its name is `README.md`.
```sh
dt
```
If you are working with other people who use [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) but you want to use dt, you can use its compatiblity mode which enables you to use dt with doctoc's comments rather than using dt's comments. So, for example, if the table of contents looks a bit like this:
```sh
<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->
- [hello world](#hello-world)
	- [I <3 Linux](#i-<3-linux)
<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
```
and you wish to update it with dt, simply run:
```sh
dt -c
```
